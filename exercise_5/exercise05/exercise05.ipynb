    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Model mismatch is a frequent source of control inaccuracy in real-world applications of MPC. Since MPC is a optimization-based control method, MPCs will try to exploit the given model dynamics as much as possible, which may cause it to become instable with the real dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "One research direction is to find a good approximation of the difference $d(x,u)$ between the nominal model $f_{\\text{nominal}}(x,u)$ and the real model, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot{x} = f_{\\text{nominal}}(x,u) + d(x,u),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approximation can be achieved via learning-based methods, and Gaussian Processes (GPs) are one such method. \n",
    "\n",
    "GPs have the inherent advantage that they also provide uncertainty estimations which can be used to ensure stochastic constaint statisfaction and to improve the robustness of the MPC controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we focus on GP-MPC which models the residual dynamics with GPs and uses the uncertainty estimations to propagate the nominal constaints into the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then compare the performance between GP-MPC and nominal MPC when tracking a trajectory with a simulated drone under model mismatch."

The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) approximation is a method used to make Gaussian Process (GP) regression scalable for large datasets by reducing its computational complexity. FITC introduces a small set of inducing points, which are pseudo-inputs that summarize the information in the full dataset. Instead of directly modeling the full covariance matrix of the training data, FITC assumes conditional independence of the training points given the inducing points. This allows the covariance matrix to be approximated efficiently, reducing the computational cost of GP inference from $ \\mathcal{O}(N^3) $ to $ \\mathcal{O}(M^2N) $, where $ M $ is the number of inducing points $( M \\ll N )$.\n",

    "### Discussion: Performance of MPC and GP-MPC Controllers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Doesn't MPC Track the Reference Well, Even with the Correct Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control Constraints & Cost Function Tuning:**  \n",
    "  The MPCâs tracking performance is fundamentally limited by actuator constraints (e.g., thrust, rate limits) and the weights in the cost function. If the cost function is not carefully tuned to prioritize tracking the most important states (such as x and y positions), or if input penalties are too high, the controller may avoid aggressive maneuvers and tolerate tracking errors. Hard constraints can also prevent the controller from following aggressive or sharp trajectory segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference Trajectory Feasibility:**  \n",
    "  The reference trajectory itself may be physically infeasible or require actions that exceed the systemâs capabilities. Even with a perfect model, the controller cannot track a trajectory that is not dynamically feasible given the systemâs physical and actuation limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Structure, Underactuation, and Real-World Effects:**  \n",
    "  Even with a perfect model, real-world factors such as unmodeled dynamics, sensor noise, disturbances, and discretization errors can degrade tracking. Underactuated systems (where not all degrees of freedom are directly controlled) further limit tracking performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prediction Horizon Limitations:**  \n",
    "  The finite prediction horizon of MPC means the controller can only optimize over a limited future window. A short horizon can limit the ability to anticipate and plan for future trajectory changes, especially for aggressive or rapidly changing references.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Doesn't GP-MPC Improve Dramatically Over MPC?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marginal Gains After Initial Learning:**  \n",
    "  GP-MPC often shows some improvement over nominal MPC after initial training, as the GP learns to correct systematic model errors. However, further improvements typically plateau. The GP can only correct for model errors it has seen in the training data, and its generalization is limited by the diversity and representativeness of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Efficiency & Generalization:**  \n",
    "  GPs require sufficient and representative data to accurately model the residual dynamics. If the training data does not cover the full range of operating conditions, or is too limited, the GPâs corrections will be incomplete or inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Structure & Expressiveness:**  \n",
    "  The GPâs input selection, kernel choice, and output structure may not be expressive enough to capture all relevant model errors. Over-regularization or poor hyperparameter choices can lead to underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uncertainty Propagation & Constraint Tightening:**  \n",
    "  GP-MPC propagates uncertainty through the dynamics and tightens constraints to ensure probabilistic safety. If the GPâs uncertainty estimates are inaccurate, or if the constraint tightening is too conservative, the controller may become overly cautious, reducing its ability to exploit the learned model and track the reference closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational and Practical Limitations:**  \n",
    "  Sparse GP approximations (e.g., FITC) are used for tractability, but can reduce GP accuracy, especially for highly nonlinear or high-dimensional systems. Limited computational resources may restrict the number of inducing points or training iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MPC performance is fundamentally limited by system constraints, cost function design, and model accuracy.** Even with a perfect model, perfect tracking is generally not possible due to these limitations.\n",
    "- **GP-MPC can improve performance by learning and compensating for model errors,** but its effectiveness is limited by the quality and quantity of training data, the expressiveness of the GP model, and the conservatism introduced by uncertainty propagation.\n",
    "- **Perfect tracking is rarely achievable in practice.** Both MPC and GP-MPC are subject to fundamental trade-offs between safety, robustness, performance, and computational complexity.\n",
    "- **Further improvements may require richer data, better model structures, or hybrid learning/model-based approaches.**"
