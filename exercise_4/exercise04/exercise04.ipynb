    "## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "Data collection and processing are critical steps in any machine learning pipeline, especially in robotics, where the data quality is extremly critical and data collection often difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we collect state transitions from a simulated quadrotor drone flying in a noisy environment using a pretrained DRL policy (which you will see again in exercise 06). These transitions include sequences of states, actions, and the resulting next states. Of course, in practice data collection is done in real-world environments, not in simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review some fundamental concepts in data collection and processing.\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "- **\"Garbage in, Garbage out\"**: The performance of data-based methods is strongly dependent on the available data. If the data training is poor or unrepresentative, the resulting model will also perform poorly. However, it may not show that during training, which is why critically evaluating the learning process is an important task when training data-based models.\n",
    "<!-- - **Simulation vs Real-World Deployment**: Simulations are faster, easier, and safer compared to real-world data collection. They allow for controlled environments and reproducibility. However, simulations often lack the details and imperfections of real-world scenarios, such as sensor noise, environmental variability, and unexpected dynamics. Simulators themselves are often built using real-world data to approximate reality. -->\n",
    "- **Importance of Data Diversity**: Diversity in the collected data is key to preventing overfitting and enabling generalization. A diverse dataset ensures that the model can handle a wide range of scenarios, including varying initial conditions, different trajectories or behaviors, and environmental factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Before training a model, data is almost always processed to improve learning efficiency and model performance. Key preprocessing steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalization**: \n",
    "   - Normalizing input features (e.g., states and actions) ensures that all features have similar scales. This prevents certain features from dominating the learning process and often significantly improves the performance of NNs and other data-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Augmentation**:\n",
    "   - Augmenting the data by adding noise, rotations, scaling, or other transformations can increase the effective dataset size and improve the model's robustness to variations. This is particularly useful when the available dataset is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Splitting**:\n",
    "   - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to assess the final model performance."

    "## 2 Gaussian Process Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful tools for regression tasks, especially in robotics, where quantifying uncertainty is crucial. In this section, we review the fundamentals of Gaussian Processes and regression, introduce the task of implementing a custom multi-output GP model, and discuss the difference between learning complete dynamics and residual dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of Gaussian Processes\n",
    "- **Gaussian Processes** are non-parametric models that define a distribution over functions. They are particularly useful for regression because they provide both predictions and associated uncertainty estimates.\n",
    "- A GP is fully specified by a **mean function** and a **kernel (covariance) function**:\n",
    "  - The **mean function** gives the expected value of the function at any input.\n",
    "  - The **kernel function** measures similarity between inputs and determines the smoothness and complexity of the function.\n",
    "- GPs are best suited for small to medium-sized datasets due to their computational complexity, which scales cubically with the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Overview: Implementing a Multi-Output Gaussian Process Model\n",
    "In this section, you will:\n",
    "1. Implement a custom multi-output GP model.\n",
    "2. Fit the GP model to previously collected training data.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the model’s performance by predicting the mean and uncertainty of the next states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation involves:\n",
    "- Defining a **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel**, commonly used for its smoothness properties.\n",
    "- Completing the **predict()** function to compute the posterior mean and variance for new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Complete Dynamics vs. Residual Dynamics\n",
    "When modeling system dynamics, two common approaches are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Complete Dynamics**:\n",
    "   - The GP learns the entire mapping from the current state and action to the next state.\n",
    "   - This approach typically requires more data and is computationally more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learning Residual Dynamics**:\n",
    "   - If a base model $f_\\mathrm{base}$ is available (e.g., a physics-based model or an informed guess), the GP learns the residuals $y_\\mathrm{res} = y - f_\\mathrm{base}(x)$.\n",
    "   - This approach is often more stable and data-efficient, as the GP only models the discrepancies between the base model and observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will focus on learning the complete dynamics due to a simpler implementation. However, in practice, learning residual dynamics is often preferred when a reliable base model is available. The next exercise (GP-MPC) will deal with such a residual model learning setup."

    "Neural Networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data to learn patterns and make predictions. Fundamentally, neural networks are overparameterized, complex functions whose parameters are optimized using a dataset to minimize a loss function, thereby modeling the relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we give a short, nonexhaustive introduction to NNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Neural Networks?\n",
    "Neural Networks excel in tasks involving large datasets and complex, non-linear relationships due to their:\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handle high-dimensional inputs and large datasets effectively.\n",
    "- **Expressiveness**: Approximate any continuous function with sufficient data and capacity (Universal Approximation Theorem).\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Adapt to tasks like regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "- **End-to-End Learning**: Learn directly from raw data, reducing the need for feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of Neural Networks\n",
    "- **Input Layer**: Receives the input features (e.g., states, actions, and observations in robotics).\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers**: Extract patterns and relationships in the data. Stacking layers increases capacity.\n",
    "- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions (e.g., next states when learning dynamics).\n",
    "- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters adjusted during training to minimize prediction error.\n",
    "- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity, enabling the model to learn complex relationships (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts When Training Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Architecture Choice**\n",
    "The architecture of a neural network defines its capacity to learn and generalize from data. Key considerations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depth and Width**: Depth and width refer to the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer, respectively. Deeper networks can learn hierarchical features but are computationally expensive and prone to vanishing gradients while wider layers increase capacity but may lead to overfitting if not regularized.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity to the model. Common choices include:\n",
    "  - **ReLU**: Efficient and widely used for hidden layers.\n",
    "  - **Sigmoid/Tanh**: Useful for specific tasks but prone to vanishing gradients.\n",
    "  - **Softmax**: Often used in the output layer for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layer Types**:\n",
    "  - **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers**: Standard for general-purpose tasks.\n",
    "  - **Convolutional Layers**:  Ideal for image processing tasks due to their ability to leverage the spatial structure of images. They process localized regions (receptive fields) to capture spatial features, use parameter sharing to reduce complexity, provide translation invariance for detecting features regardless of position.\n",
    "  - **Recurrent Layers**: Suitable for sequential data like time series or text (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs).\n",
    "  - **Transformer Layers**: State-of-the-art for natural language processing and vision tasks. Use self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and relationships in the data, enabling efficient parallel processing and improved performance on sequential and spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task-Specific Architectures**:\n",
    "  - **ResNet**: For image classification, uses skip connections to mitigate vanishing gradients.\n",
    "  - **U-Net**: For image segmentation, combines encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections.\n",
    "  - **Transformer**: For NLP and vision tasks, excels in capturing long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Enabling Generalization**\n",
    "In the end, the goal is for models to perform well on unseen data. While NNs (with suitable architecture and hyperparameter choice) generally perform well on the training data, generalization is much more difficult to achieve. Methods to achieve generalization are generally called regularization techniques. Moreover, splitting the dataset into training, test, and validation sets allows evaluating underfitting, overfitting, and hyperparameter selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detecting Underfitting and Overfitting**:\n",
    "    - **Learning Curves**: Plot training and validation losses over epochs. Converging and similar test and training losses indicates good generalization. \n",
    "  - **Underfitting**: Training and validation losses are high, indicating the model is too simple or insufficiently trained.\n",
    "  - **Overfitting**: Training loss is low, but validation loss is high, indicating the model is memorizing the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization Techniques**:\n",
    "  - **Early Stopping**: Stop training when validation loss stops improving.\n",
    "  - **Dropout**: Randomly deactivate neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation.\n",
    "  - **Batch Normalization**: Normalize layer inputs to stabilize and accelerate training.\n",
    "  - **Weight Regularization**: Add L1 or L2 penalties to the loss function to constrain model complexity.\n",
    "  - **Skip Connections**: Counteracts vanishing and exploding gradients by improving gradient flow between layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**\n",
    "Hyperparameters control the training process and model architecture. Optimizing them is essential for achieving strong performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Hyperparameters**:\n",
    "  - **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size for weight updates. Too high may cause divergence; too low can slow convergence. Many optimizers (e.g., Adam) adapt the learning rate during training.\n",
    "  - **Batch Size**: Smaller batches introduce more noise but allow more frequent updates. Larger batches are more stable but require more memory.\n",
    "  - **Number of Epochs**: Specifies how many times the model sees the entire dataset.\n",
    "- **Optimization Methods**:\n",
    "  - **Grid Search**: Exhaustively searches over a predefined set of hyperparameter values, but is often inefficient.\n",
    "  - **Random Search**: Samples random combinations of hyperparameters and is generally more efficient than grid search.\n",
    "  - **Bayesian Optimization**: Uses probabilistic models to efficiently search for optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**: Splits the dataset into multiple folds to evaluate model performance across different subsets, providing a more robust estimate of generalization.\n",
    "- **Validation Set**: Always use a separate validation set to evaluate hyperparameter choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Training Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalize Input Data**: Ensure that input features have similar scales and counteract vanishing or exploding gradients.\n",
    "2. **Monitor Learning Curves**: Use training, validation, and test losses to diagnose underfitting, overfitting, and the effects of hyperparameters.\n",
    "3. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic model and increase complexity only as needed.\n",
    "4. **Use Pretrained Models**: Leverage pretrained models when available to save time and improve performance.\n",
    "5. **Automate Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use methods like random search or Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore hyperparameter space."
